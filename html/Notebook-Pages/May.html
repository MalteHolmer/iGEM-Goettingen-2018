        <p>Strains BP233, BP235 and 168 (WT) were incubated in 4 ml LB medium for 4 h at 37°C and 220 rpm. 2 ml of the culture was harvested, and the cells were washed in 1xC-salts and then resuspended in 300 µl 1xC-salts. BP233 and BP235 were plated on CS-glucose with and without 10 mM glyphosate.</p>

        <p>As seen in this figure, both strains grow well on CS-glucose without glyphosate. Strain BP233 also forms a lawn on plates with 10mM glyphosate, while the wildtype does not form a lawn, but single colonies, which could be suppressor mutants. This leads to the hypothesis that GltT, which is a glutamate transporter, transports glyphosate into the cell. The strain BP235 was not stable, so it was constructed again!
